##Challenge Summary

This script can be used for various types of elections. This code would most likely be used in elections that have "jurisdictions and candiates" .
For example  this code can be used for a school election. The part of the code that is used to gather the information on cadidates should remain the same.
however countys can be modified to relect the different grades(6th grade ,7th grade,8th grade).

Additionally , this code can also be used in a larger election like a national election. The code used to calculate the info on the cadidates should remain the same.
The counties can be subsitued by states.
